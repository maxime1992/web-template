**[DEPRECATED] Web-Template is now deprecated and you should rather use [web-template-webpack](https://github.com/kevincaradant/web-template-webpack) which has a better ES6 syntax with support for classes and import statement thanks to webpack.**  
You can also find 2 branches within this project, one with angular-material setup and another one with angular-material + ng-redux.

Web-Template

Change Log

This project generates the CHANGELOG.md from Git metadata using the conventional-changelog library. The commit message must follow the Angular conventions.

# Quick custom
Before you really start your own project, I recommend you to search for "CUSTOM" occurrences in the project.
Everything with CUSTOM is something you may want to change.

# Contribution
I think the project has a nice & clean structure.
If you have better ideas I would be glad to hear from you and why not propose a pull request.

In order to contribute, please run `npm test` and check you don't have any JSHint error by running `gulp xo`
