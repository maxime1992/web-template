WebTemplate
===================

# Why ?
If you often create new web projects, you know how long it can be to start from scratch :clock8:.  
You just need to kick start your project :rocket: ? This repo has been made for you !  

# What's in the magic box ?
I propose a configuration but of course, you can customize it.  

:punch: To manage the project :
- Npm
- Gulp (Karma & LiveReload)
- Less

:thumbsup: Librairies into the project :
- Bootstrap
- Font-Awesome
- Angular
	- angular-mocks
	- angular-translate
	- angular-sanitize
	- angular-ui-bootstrap
  - angular-animate

# How to start ?
:video_game: When you start a new project from this archetype :  

- Run `npm install` 

- Run `npm run dev` or `npm run prod`

# Quick custom
Before you really start your own projet, I recommend you to search for "CUSTOM" occurrences in the project.  
Everything with CUSTOM is something you may want to change.

# Contribution
I think the project has a nice & clean structure.  
If you have better ideas I would be glad to hear from you and why not propose a pull request ... :wink:  
(Tho, it's only my second public repo on github I have no idea how pull request works, be kind and comprehensive if I make some mistakes).  

In order to contribute, please run `npm test` and check you don't have any JSHint error by running `xo` :tada:.  

Cheers !
